# Solvent pre-selection for extractive distillation

This repo contains the code used in the paper Solvent pre-selection for extractive distillation using Gibbs-Helmholtz Graph Neural Networks.

The main functions to perform solvent selection are collected in the ```solvent_preselection.py``` file. 

Case studies for solvent selection for the separation of aliphatic/aromatic and olefin/paraffin mixtures are provided on the rest of the files. These cases are discussed in the above mentioned paper.
